only forward IP packets

lets say we get a packet in r1, and its destination is 10.1.0.16
compare the destination address in the packet, against the prefixes in the first column of the file
	- we're looking for a prefix match, bits of address matching bits of prefix, for the number of bits (/16 or /24) specified

once we find a match:
	the third column is the port you want to forward the packet out of
		(is an interface just a port?)

	when it has a middle column:
		its not directly connected, must use an intermediate node to get to it
		link layer destination must be the IP address of the intermediate node (given in the middle column)

		arp the interface (third column) with ip (second column), get mac address from intermediate
		forward data packet to intermediate

	intermediate receives data packet, which contains the final destination in the IP header

	(only change mac addresses in link layer when forwarding, dont change ip header addresses)

	in ip header, change time to live. timeToLive -= 1 every time you go through a router

	ipheader also has checksum, which must be recalculated every hop

	forwarding tells us what networks are out there and how to get to them
	arp tell us mac address of an ip address


- When you connect via the lookup table if there is not a corresponding address, you can just find the requesting data from the packet and forward to there.
- Never change IP address in IP hader when forwarding, but you do change the MAC, you can use the ip heder to match things in the table
- Two things you change in IP header: time to live (subtract 1 each hop), checksum (remake and re add)

- With router 1 you must mastch with destination address only, the table gives the appropritate interface etc. r1 ALWAYS knows prefixes, just not specific hosts
- r1 knows the direction based on prefix, it will arp all of the hosts and if it gets an answer then sends to the right spot based on destination mac

General:
Get packet, see if IP packet, if not IP don't forward it

Need to send an arp request to the router of choice
MAKE A MAP of all the stuff waiting on a MAC for a particular IP
Then when you get the Mac you can just fire all of the waiting packets off
